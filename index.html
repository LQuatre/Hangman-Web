              Hangman is a classic word game in which you must guess as many
              secret words as you can before time runs out! Challenge your
              friends and learn new words, one letter at a time!

          <h1>Rules</h1>
          <p>
            The rules of Hangman are simple. Guess the word by selecting letters
            from the alphabet.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you guess the word correctly, you win! If you guess the word
            incorrectly, you lose a life.
          </p>
          <p>
            You have 10 lives. If you lose all your lives, you lose the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also use the keyboard to play. Press the letter on your
            keyboard to select it. Press the space bar to submit your guess.
